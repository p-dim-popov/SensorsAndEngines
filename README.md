Sensors And Engines
---
This project collects data from various sensors from an engine using Arduino and plots the data through ASP.NET Core MVC application in real-time scatter chart.

Special thanks to [alex4o](https://github.com/alex4o) for introducing me to [Google's Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and leading me through this mechanism for serializing structured data.
